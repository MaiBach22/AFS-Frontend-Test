# Developer Applicant Test Project

This is a clean Vue 3 project set up for potential developers applying to AFS Energy. The project uses Vue 3, TypeScript, and Graphql to test your knowledge and see how you develop.

## Getting Started

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Run server
yarn graphql
```

## Your Task

### Table page

#### Add a row

On the "Table" page is a table, add a row to this table that displays the total calories, sugar and price of rows on that specific page.

#### Change data

Design and execute a way to change the sugar content of a fruit.

### Trade page

#### Fetch the trades from the suplied graphql server

You can run the server with ```yarn graphql``` and look into schema.graphql to find the details of the trades query you will need. You will not be judged on the implementation of the endpoint.

#### Create the following card design

Recreate the layout in this design, but use the fetched trade data to populate it. Then render all trades on this page using this card. The data used in the design is different from what is supplied in the graphql server, use data that make sense to you.
